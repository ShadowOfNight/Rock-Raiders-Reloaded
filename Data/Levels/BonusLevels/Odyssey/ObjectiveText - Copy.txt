[Level01]
Objective:			Our mining operations have not been going smoothly. Undergrounds floods, lava streams and teleporter malfunctions have caused the Rock Raider HQ to be scattered across the caverns. \a Several Rock Raiders are trapped on islands and in caverns. \a To make things worse, there are no readily available energy crystals; while there are large deposits of crystals in caverns to the North and South, there does not seem to be direct access to them. \a In addition, caverns to the East are unstable and infested with monsters. \a Faced with this predicament, team of brave Rock Raiders on a small island have decided to salvage what they can and attempt to rebuild the Rock Raider HQ. \a They will need all the help they can get from the buildings and Raiders scattered across the caverns. \a Objectives: 1 Rescue the Raider trapped near the Geological Center and the one trapped in the Southeast. 2 Collect 40 energy crystals and 200 ore. 3 Construct two Support Stations and two Granite Grinders.  OPTIONAL objectives: 1. Find the floating super teleport 2. Access the hidden cavern to the South containing several Recharge Seams.
Failure:			Is the level too hard? Here are some tips: 1. Lasers can shoot a target several squares away 2. A rapid rider can carry anything a Rock Raider can carry 3. Do not teleport away Raiders or buildings unless you are sure you do not need them anymore.
