[Odyssey]
Objective:			Our mining operations have not been going smoothly. Underground floods and teleporter malfunctions have caused our Raiders, buildings and vehicles to be scattered across the caverns. \aSeveral Rock Raiders are trapped on islands. To make things worse, there are no readily available energy crystals in walls; while there are large deposits of crystals in caverns to the North and South, there does not seem to be direct access to them. \aFaced with this predicament, a team of brave Rock Raiders on a small island have decided to salvage what they can and attempt to rebuild the Rock Raider HQ. \aThey will need all the help they can get. \aObjectives: 1 Find all 5 lost Raiders (not counting those visible at the start). 2 Collect 40 energy crystals and 200 ore. 3 Construct two Support Stations and two Granite Grinders. \aOPTIONAL: Reach and rebuild the old HQ to the South (one of each building).
Failure:			Is the level too hard? Here are some tips: 1. Lasers can shoot a target several squares away 2. A rapid rider can carry anything a Rock Raider can carry 3. Do not teleport away Raiders or buildings unless you are sure you do not need them anymore. 4 Upgrade your Mining Laser before firing it to save crystals! 5 You will need to build a Super Teleport in the starting area.
