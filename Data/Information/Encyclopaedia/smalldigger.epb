THE SMALL DIGGER

The small digger is more efficent at digging than the Rockraider figures.
It uses a powerful chainsaw action to hack away at soft, medium or compacted soil. 
It can be used to cut into hard rock and ice but it blunts the blades fairly quickly.
Tip: Sharpen the blades as often as possible to maintain maximum efficency.
