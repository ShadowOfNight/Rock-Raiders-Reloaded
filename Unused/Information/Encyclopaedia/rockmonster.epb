THE ROCK MONSTER

The Rock Monster is the main foe of the LEGO Rock Raiders.
Rock Monsters show no fear in attacking vehicles. However if any mining tool repeatedly hits it, it will eventually give up the attack and retreat.
The Rock Monster is able to move through rock walls at will, although it slows down.
Tip: Rock Monsters steal crystals, so do not leave your crystals unguarded.
