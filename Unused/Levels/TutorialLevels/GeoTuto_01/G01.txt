This lesson will show you how to build and use the Geo-Dome, and how to train 'Geologists' to see what is in the hidden parts of the rock.
The first thing we must do is build a path so we can power our Geo-Dome.
We will build the path by the Power-Station, so click on the ground here.
Now to build the path, you must click on the flashing 'Build Path' icon in the top right corner of the screen.
Watch as your Rock-Raider carries the ore to the ground on which we wish to build the path.
What we need to do now is build a Geo-Dome, so click on the build icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen.
Now we need to select the building we want to build, so click on the flashing 'Geo-Dome' icon.
We want to place this building next to our path, so place the building on the ground here.
While your Rock-Raider prepares the building site, let's take a look at the radar panel.
