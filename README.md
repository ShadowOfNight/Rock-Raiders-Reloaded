# Rock Raiders Reloaded
Revamp project for the 1999 LEGO game, Rock Raiders.

Goals include:
--------------

- Upgrading the existing game models.
- Cleaning up various aspects of configuration file code.
- Properly sorting shared textures and models.
- Adding new creatures, objects, buildings, vehicles, and levels to the game.
- Reactivating cut content from the original game.
- New tutorials to reflect changes to various gameplay elements.
- New voiceovers (which is very questionable at this time).

If you wish to contribute to the project, please contact me through email, or at my Discord handle shadowknight#1817.

A license will be added once an initial release is made. Until then, this project is not to be redistrubited or modified without my consent.
